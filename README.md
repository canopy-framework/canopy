# Welcome to Canopy

In order to run Canopy, you need to have the following prerequisites set up on your system:
* `aws` command, you can find more information on how to set it up [here](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
* Node.js 16
* SQLite3

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app. The build step is not required when using JavaScript.

## Useful commands

* `npm run test`         perform the jest unit tests
* `cdk deploy`           deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`             compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk synth`            emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
* `cdk destroy`          destroy a particular stack or your entire deployed pipeline
